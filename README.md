# Logo

My logo

### Story

My logo is actually the solution to a puzzle that I was given as a child.

"Connect a 3x3 grid of evenly spaced points with four straight lines without taking your pencil off the paper." 

Most people's first attempts stay inside the boundary of the grid. However, the problem can only be solved when you use lines that go outside these bounds. To me, this puzzle has always been the perfect illustration of our mind's tendency to build artificial, and often unnecessary, constraints, and the solution is quite literally to "think outside the box".

I chose to use the solution to this puzzle as my logo to be a constant reminder to consider all possibilities when looking at a problem. 

Although in spirit the logo is "final", its design has much to be desired. If you have any suggestions or input on that, please let me know!
